            <h3>THE BEAUTY OF NATURE</h3>
            <p>the concept of nature has evolved significantly. Aristotle's geocentric view, for example, posited that a heavy body falls to the earth because the center of the cosmos is its natural position, not because it is drawn to the earth itself.
                This contrasts with the atomistic conception, where matter is seen as mostly empty space, with the actual amount of solid matter in the universe being very small.</p>

            <h3>The greatest gift of life on the mountain is time.</h3>
            <p>Several theories explain the formation of mountains. One prominent theory is the plate tectonics theory, which states that mountains form where two continental plates collide. Since both plates have a similar thickness and weight, neither one will sink under the other. Instead, they crumple and fold until the rocks are forced up to form a mountain range.</p>

            <h3>Men argue. Nature acts.</h3>
            <p>Another theory is the convection current theory proposed by Arthur Holmes in 1928-29. This theory suggests that convection currents in the Earth's mantle cause the movement of tectonic plates, leading to mountain building and continental drift.</p>
